			<p>When thinking of the Democracy Project, I often think about the way in which we have access to technologies. In Jonathan Keats' project, he imagines an experimental photobooth that uses biometric data from the user to initiate an action from an A.I. version of congress. My prototype is an App version of that. I imagine the voting booth in the pockets of citizens. Obviously this is all experimental but I think if we are rethinking voting technology, why not make a mobile version like everything else in the world. The link connects to a PoeNet Project I was working on that detects facial and body movements. I used the ML5 9machine-learning) to get this to work properly.</p>

      <b>Experiemental advertisement for Democracy Project, Martin Guevara, 2020</b>

			<p>This is an experiemtnal advertisement video made for the Democracy Project. Unintentionally, I have created a rather haunting and scary advertisement for this project but I think that in some ways it fits the themes of government and voting technologies. The ominous sounds of children, women, men, and androids saying the Pledge of Allegiance in disunity bring me to a future where the singularity has taken full effect and A.I. have been giving the right to vote.</p>
